/* 
"extend" (Intersection Type) is a very common pattern in JavaScript 
where you take two objects and create a new one that has the features of both these objects. 

An Intersection Type allows you to use this pattern in a safe way.

  const x = extend({ a: "hello" }, { b: 42 });

  // x now has both `a` and `b`
  const a = x.a;
  const b = x.b;
